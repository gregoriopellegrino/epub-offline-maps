#epub-offline-maps

An EPUB widget to display offline maps with geolocation and POIs

## Project
The idea is to make available interactive offline maps in EPUBs for making travel guides and other publications.  
Since it isn't possible to embed an online map into an EPUB (like Google Maps), I looked for a solution to make it available offline.  
Offline maps are perfects because they work also when you are abroad and you don't have an internet connection.  

## How I did
I looked for a solution for offline maps on mobile devices and I found this article: http://davidrs.com/wp/phonegap-3-0-leaflet-offline-maps/  
Then I used Mobile Atlas Creator (http://mobac.sourceforge.net/) for downloading the tiles of the region I was interested: Turin (my town) in Italy.  
I downloaded the JavaScript library Leaflet (http://leafletjs.com/)  
I packaged all in an EPUB3 file *et voilat*, it works!

## Test
The project has been tested on:
- Adobe Digital Editions 4.0 (on OS X Yosemite): **OK**
- iBooks 1.1 (on OS X Yosemite): **doesn't work**
- iBooks 3.2 (on iOS 7.0.6): **doesn't work**
- Readium (on Chrome): **OK**

## Todo
- add the geolocation (http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#map-locate)
- add POIs
- test on Readium SDK (Kobo, ecc.)
- pack it as an EPUB widget (http://www.idpf.org/epub/widgets/)
